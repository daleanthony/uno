# Uno for Ghost

***

Uno for Ghost is the result of my first 'mini-project' of 2014. The theme features a minimal, responsive design with a cover page, disqus comment integration, foundation icons and various colour options.

***

## Demo  
There's a demo of the theme running on my personal website, [daleanthony.com](http://daleanthony.com)

## Features

**Cover page**  
The landing page for Uno is a full screen 'cover' featuring your avatar, blog title, mini-bio and cover image. 

**Built with SASS, using BEM**  
If you know HTML and CSS making modifications to the theme should be super simple.

**Responsive**  
Uno looks great on all devices, even those weird phablets that nobody buys.

**Disqus comments**  
Disqus integration allows users to comment on your posts.

**Foundation icons**  
Uno contains the [Foundation icon font by Zurb](http://zurb.com/playground/foundation-icon-fonts-3) which means you can easily add icons. A full list of available icons can be found on the [Foundation Icon](http://zurb.com/playground/foundation-icon-fonts-3) website.

**No-JS fallback**  
While JS is widely used, some themes and websites don't provide fallback for when no JS is available (I'm looking at you [Squarespace](http://blog.squarespace.com/)). If for some weird reason a visitor has JS disabled your blog will still be useable.

**Development**  
Ghost is still a work in progress with many features not yet implemented, as Ghost gets updated new features will be added to Uno.

**1 theme, 5 colour options**  
Uno includes 5 different colour options for you to chose from.
